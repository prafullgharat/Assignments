            <div id="Introduction">
                <h1>
                    What is CSS?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="Advantages">
                <h1>
                    Advantages of CSS
                </h1>
                <p>CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.</p>
                <p>Pages load faster − If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.</p>
                <p>Easy maintenance − To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</p>
                <p>Superior styles to HTML − CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</p>

                <p>Multiple Device Compatibility − Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.</p>
              
            </div>

            <div id="Syntax">
                <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
                <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

                    The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
                    
                    Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
                    
                    Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>
                    <p>Example explained</p>
                        <p>Line 1: using System means that we can use classes from the System namespace.</p>Line 1: using System means that we can use classes from the System namespace.
                        
                        <p>Line 2: A blank line. C# ignores white space. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.</p>
                        
                        <p>Line 3: namespace is a used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces.</p>
                        
                        <p>Line 4: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.</p>
                        
                        <p>Line 5: class is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program. Every line of code that runs in C# must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Program.</p>
            </div>


            <div id="Comments">
                <h1>CSS Comments</h1>
                <h3> Single-line Comments</h3>
                <p>Comments can be used to explain C# code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

                    Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).<br>

                    Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by C# (will not be executed).<br>


                    This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code
                </p>
                <h3> Multi-line Comments</h3>
                <p>Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.

                    Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by C#.
                    
                    This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code</p>
            </div>


            <div id="Selector">
                <h1> CSS Selector</h1>
                <p>CSS selectors are used to select the content you want to style. Selectors are the part of CSS rule set. CSS selectors select HTML elements according to its id, class, type, attribute etc.</p>

                <h3>1)CSS ID Selector</h3>
                <p>The id selector selects the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. An id is always unique within the page so it is chosen to select a single, unique element.

                    It is written with the hash character (#), followed by the id of the element.</p>
                <h3>3) CSS Class Selector</h3>

                <h1>How to add CSS</h1>

                <p>CSS is added to HTML pages to format the document according to information in the style sheet. There are three ways to insert CSS in HTML documents.</p>
                <h3>1) Inline CSS</h3>

            </div>

            <div id="Background">

                <h3>3) CSS background-repeat</h3>
                <p>By default, the background-image property repeats the background image horizontally and vertically. Some images are repeated only horizontally or vertically.

                    The background looks better if the image repeated horizontally only.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="Border">
                <h1>CSS Border
                </h1>
                <p>The CSS border is a shorthand property used to set the border on an element.

                    The CSS border properties are use to specify the style, color and size of the border of an element. The CSS border properties are given below
                </p>
                <h3>1) CSS border-style</h3>
                <p>The Border style property is used to specify the border type which you want to display on the web page.

                <p>The border-width property is used to set the border's width. It is set in pixels. You can also use the one of the three pre-defined values, thin, medium or thick to set the width of the border.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="Display">
                <h1>CSS Display
                </h1>
                <p>CSS display is the most important property of CSS which is used to control the layout of the element. It specifies how the element is displayed.

                </p>
                <p>Every element has a default display value according to its nature. Every element on the webpage is a rectangular box and the CSS property defines the behavior of that rectangular box.

                </p>
                <h3>1) CSS display inline</h3>
                <p>The inline element takes the required width only. It doesn't force the line break so the flow of text doesn't break in inline example.

                </p>
                <h3>2) CSS display inline-block</h3>
                <p>
                    The CSS display inline-block element is very similar to inline element but the difference is that you are able to set the width and height.
                </p>
                <h3>3) CSS display block</h3>
                <p>The CSS display block element takes as much as horizontal space as they can. Means the block element takes the full available width. They make a line break before and after them.
                    
                </p>

            </div>
            <div id="Float">
                <h1>CSS Float
                </h1>
                <p>The CSS float property is a positioning property. It is used to push an element to the left or right, allowing other element to wrap around it. It is generally used with images and layouts.

                </p>
                <p>To understand its purpose and origin, let's take a look to its print display. In the print display, image is set into the page such that text wraps around it as needed.

                </p>
                <p>A floated element may be moved as far to the left or the right as possible. Simply, it means that a floated element can display at extreme left or extreme right.
                </p>
                <p>The elements after the floating element will flow around it.
                </p>
                <p>The elements before the floating element will not be affected.
                </p>
                <p>If the image floated to the right, the texts flow around it, to the left and if the image floated to the left, the text flows around it, to the right.
                </p>
            </div>


            <div id="Font">
                <h1>CSS Font
                </h1>
                <p>CSS Font property is used to control the look of texts. By the use of CSS font property you can change the text size, color, style and more. You have already studied how to make text bold or underlined. Here, you will also know how to resize your font using percentage.

                </p>
                <h3>1) CSS Font Color</h3>
                <p>CSS font color is a standalone attribute in CSS although it seems that it is a part of CSS fonts. It is used to change the color of the text.

                </p>
                <h3>2) CSS Font Family</h3>
                <p>CSS font family can be divided in two types:

                    Generic family: It includes Serif, Sans-serif, and Monospace.
                    Font family: It specifies the font family name like Arial, New Times Roman etc.</p>

            </div>

            <div id="Colors">
                <h1>CSS Colors</h1>
                <p>The color property in CSS is used to set the color of HTML elements. Typically, this property is used to set the background color or the font color of an element.

                    In CSS, we use color values for specifying the color. We can also use this property for the border-color and other decorative effects.
                </p>

                <h3>RGB Format</h3>
                <p>RGB format is the short form of 'RED GREEN and BLUE' that is used for defining the color of an HTML element simply by specifying the values of R, G, B that are in the range of 0 to 255.

                    The color values in this format are specified by using the rgb() property. This property allows three values that can either be in percentage or integer (range from 0 to 255).
                    
                    This property is not supported in all browsers; that's why it is not recommended to use it.
                    
                    Syntax</p>

                <h3>RGBA Format</h3>
                <p>It is almost similar to RGB format except that RGBA contains A (Alpha) that specifies the element's transparency. The value of alpha is in the range 0.0 to 1.0, in which 0.0 is for fully transparent, and 1.0 is for not transparent.</p>

                <h3>Hexadecimal notation</h3>
                <p>Hexadecimal can be defined as a six-digit color representation. This notation starts with the # symbol followed by six characters ranges from 0 to F. In hexadecimal notation, the first two digits represent the red (RR) color value, the next two digits represent the green (GG) color value, and the last two digits represent the blue (BB) color value.

                    The black color notation in hexadecimal is #000000, and the white color notation in hexadecimal is #FFFFFF. Some of the codes in hexadecimal notation are #FF0000, #00FF00, #0000FF, #FFFF00, and many more.</p>

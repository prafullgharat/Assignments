            <p class="topic">"Sachiiiiiiin, Sachin!”</p>

            <p>Sachiiiiiiin, Sachin! You’ve heard the chant. You may not have heard of the sport, but you’ve heard the chant. The chant - one that
                 a billion people once lived by; one that would originate from the Wankhede and echo across the city and the seas. <br>
                 <br>
                 Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was that cricketer whose personality and aura upstaged any cricketing contest; 
                 yet he maintained that he wasn’t greater than than the game. To the people of India, the 5’5” giant of 
                 a man was much more than that. He was an emotion; a symbol of hope in a nation that revered him as nothing short of a God.</p>
                 <p>Cricket has seen many greats come and go, but very few would argue that anyone came close to Sachin Tendulkar. The whole of India prayed for him every time he took his stance at the crease. All those who have had the privilege of seeing him bat can proudly say: "I lived when Sachin played."

                    No one else can play the straight drive with the same elegance as the Little Master. No one else will rule the game like he did. In short, there will be no other Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar.
